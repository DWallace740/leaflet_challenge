# Leaflet Earthquake Visualization: Module 15 Challenge
## Overview

This project visualizes real-time earthquake data using Leaflet.js and D3.js. The dataset is provided by the USGS GeoJSON API, allowing users to explore earthquakes with interactive markers, popups, and a legend indicating earthquake depth.

## Features

    Interactive Map: Displays earthquake locations worldwide.

    Magnitude-based Marker Scaling: Larger circles indicate stronger earthquakes.

    Depth-based Coloring: Depth of the earthquake determines marker color.

    Popups: Show earthquake magnitude, location, and depth.

    Legend: Explains the depth-based color scale.

    Tectonic Plate Overlay (Optional): Shows tectonic plate boundaries.

    Layer Control: Switch between base maps and toggle earthquake/tectonic plate layers.

## Technologies Used

    Leaflet.js: For mapping and visualization.

    D3.js: Fetches and processes GeoJSON earthquake data.

    USGS Earthquake API: Provides real-time earthquake data.

## How to Run

    Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB/leaflet-challenge.git

    Navigate into PART ONE.

    Open index.html in a browser.

    Ensure an internet connection for API requests.

## Data Source

Earthquake data is retrieved from the USGS GeoJSON API: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_day.geojson
